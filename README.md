Scripts to make handling passwords easy ( with Vim and git and gpg ) 

---
Feel free to clone and do your own thing, you should be able to actually push
your passwords file back to public github repos but I would advise against
that. gpg symetric passwords havent been cracked easily yet, but I am sure
they will at some point.

The default password is 'change_me', after your first edit, you can just save the file with whatever other password you might want.
